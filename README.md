# Question 1.
## Development Environment.
I am using visual studio code as my preferred editor in writing the code solutions. VSCode is easy to navigate and configure for most if not all programming languages.
Getting to write C has also been made easy by the extentions that have been developed which are compatible with VS code to make code writing process easy and smooth even for someone getting started with programming.
Some of the code extentions that have been useful in writting c programs in VSCode includes C/C++ IntelliSense for easier debugging and Code Runner for running the code with the c compiler

 ## How to compile and run the source code.
 1. Open the code with the name fibonacci.c on Question 1 Folder.
 2. When all the extensiona have been installed and configured. There will be a run icon on the righ side of the VSCode.
 3. Click on the dropdown arrow next to the run icon and choose run code.
 4. Once the codes run a terminal will be opened that contains the ouput of the code once it completes executing the code.

# Question 2.
## Development Environment.
The development environment is simillar with the first question's development environment. 
 
 ## How to compile and run the source code.
 Navigate to Question 2 Folder where I have written there solutions for this problem namely;
 i. dynamic_approach.c
 ii. iterative_approach.c
 iii. recursive_approach.c

 **To run the code**
 1. Open any solution.
