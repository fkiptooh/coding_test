# Question 2.
## Development Environment.
I am using visual studio code as my preferred editor in writing the code solutions. VSCode is easy to navigate and configure for most if not all programming languages.
Getting to write C has also been made easy by the extentions that have been developed which are compatible with VS code to make code writing process easy and smooth even for someone getting started with programming.
Some of the code extentions that have been useful in writting c programs in VSCode includes C/C++ IntelliSense for easier debugging and Code Runner for running the code with the c compiler
 
 ## How to compile and run the source code.
